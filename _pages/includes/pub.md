**Yutao Hu**, Qixiong Wang, Wenqi Shao, Enze Xie, Zhenguo Li, Jungong Han, Ping Luo

[**Code**](https://github.com/toggle1995/RIS-DMMI), [**Paper**](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Hu_Beyond_One-to-One_Rethinking_the_Referring_Image_Segmentation_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf)


- We find the deficiency of referring image segmentation when meeting the one-to-many and one-to-zero text inputs, which strongly limits the application value in real-world scenarios.
- We collect a new challenging dataset, termed as RefZOM, in which the text inputs are not limited to the one-to-one setting. The proposed dataset provides a new perspective and benchmark for future research.
